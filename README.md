# Fake News Detection Project

# Overview

Welcome to the Fake News Detection project! This project aims to detect fake news articles using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system is designed to analyze the text content of news articles and determine the likelihood of them being fake or genuine.

# Features

->Text Analysis: The core of the project involves analyzing the text content of news articles. Various NLP techniques are employed to extract meaningful features from the text.

->Machine Learning Model: A machine learning model is trained on a dataset of labeled news articles to learn patterns and characteristics of fake and genuine news.

->Accuracy Metrics: The system provides accuracy metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. Users can assess how well the model is performing on the given dataset.

->User-Friendly GUI: The graphical user interface (GUI) is implemented using Tkinter, making it easy for users to interact with the system. The 
 GUI allows users to input text and receive a prediction regarding the authenticity of the news.
