# Fake News Detection Project

## Overview
This Fake News Detection project aims to develop a robust solution for identifying and categorizing fake news articles. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze text data and determine the likelihood of an article being fake or genuine.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** The project includes extensive text preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Various machine learning models, including but not limited to, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural Networks, have been implemented and compared for their effectiveness in fake news detection.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** The performance of the models is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's effectiveness.
- **Web Scraping (Optional):** If applicable, mention any web scraping techniques used to collect data for training and testing the models.

## Getting Started
